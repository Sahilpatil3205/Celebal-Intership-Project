# Celebal-Intership-Project
To analyze and understand the underlying topics in a large collection of newsgroup posts using unsupervised machine learning techniques (LDA and K-Means), and visualize how documents are grouped.
ðŸ§  Topic Modeling on 20 Newsgroups Dataset
ðŸ“Œ Description
This project performs topic modeling and document clustering using KMeans and LDA on the popular 20 Newsgroups dataset. It applies NLP preprocessing, TF-IDF, CountVectorizer, and visualizes document clusters using t-SNE.

 ðŸ“Š Techniques Used
- TfidfVectorizer & CountVectorizer
- KMeans Clustering
- Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)
- t-SNE Visualization
- NLP Preprocessing with NLTK
